                    <h3>Augmented Reality Application for Watches & Wrist Accessories</h3>
                    <p>I developed an Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to revolutionize the shopping
                        experience for watches and wrist accessories. This innovative app allows users to virtually try
                        on various watches and wrist accessories in real-time through their smartphones or tablets. By
                        leveraging AR technology, users can see how different watches and accessories look on their
                        wrists without physically trying them on, providing a more immersive and convenient shopping
                        experience. The application utilizes advanced 3D modeling and rendering techniques to ensure
                        realistic visualization, enhancing user confidence in their purchasing decisions. This project
                        not only showcases my proficiency in AR development but also demonstrates my commitment to
                        leveraging technology to enhance consumer interactions and usability in the retail sector."</p>

                    <h3>Enhancement of Restaurant Operations through QR Code Implementation</a></h3>
                    <p>I developed an Android application aimed at enhancing restaurant operations through QR code
                        integration, streamlining processes such as ordering, billing, and customer feedback. This
                        innovative solution improved operational efficiency and customer experience by providing
                        real-time updates and personalized interactions. Utilizing Java and Android Studio, I designed a
                        user-friendly interface and integrated QR code functionalities to facilitate seamless
                        communication between customers and restaurant staff. The project successfully modernized
                        restaurant management, ensuring prompt service and increased customer satisfaction through
                        effective use of digital technology.</p>

                    <h3>Weather Monitoring Website</a></h3>
                    <p>I developed a weather monitoring website utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrating a
                        Weather API to provide real-time weather information to users. The website features a
                        user-friendly interface where users can enter locations to retrieve current weather conditions,
                        forecasts, and other relevant data. Leveraging HTML and CSS, I ensured a responsive design that
                        adapts seamlessly across different devices. JavaScript was employed to handle API requests and
                        dynamically update weather information on the site without requiring page reloads. This project
                        not only honed my front-end development skills but also showcased my ability to integrate
                        third-party APIs to deliver functional and engaging web experiences centered around real-time
                        data.</p>

                    <h3>Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques</a></h3>
                    <p>I undertook a project focused on fake news detection using Artificial Intelligence and Machine
                        Learning techniques. This involved implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to
                        analyze text content and identify misleading or false information. Leveraging Python programming
                        along with libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow, I developed a model that could
                        classify news articles based on their authenticity. The project included preprocessing text
                        data, feature extraction, and training various machine learning models such as Support Vector
                        Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in data
                        preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, contributing to my proficiency in AI and ML
                        application for tackling contemporary issues like misinformation.</p>

                    <h3>Car Racing Game</a></h3>
                    <p>I developed an interactive car game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my skills in
                        frontend web development and game design. The game features dynamic visuals and smooth gameplay,
                        where players navigate a virtual road, avoiding obstacles and collecting points. It demonstrates
                        my proficiency in implementing user interfaces, animations, and event handling to create an
                        engaging and immersive gaming experience. This project not only highlights my technical
                        abilities but also reflects my passion for crafting enjoyable interactive applications.</p>

                    <h3>Quiz Application</a></h3>
                    <p> Designed and developed an interactive quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills
                        in frontend web development. The quiz features dynamic questions with multiple-choice answers,
                        providing an engaging user experience. CSS styling ensures a visually appealing interface, while
                        JavaScript handles quiz logic, including scoring and feedback mechanisms. This project not only
                        demonstrates my proficiency in frontend technologies but also highlights my ability to create
                        interactive and educational web applications..</p>

                    <h3>Hotel Management System</a></h3>
                    <p>I developed a comprehensive hotel management website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the
                        frontend to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface. The website allows users
                        to browse hotel rooms, make reservations, and view booking details. For the backend, I utilized
                        MySQL for database management and PHP for server-side scripting. MySQL was employed to store and
                        manage hotel room data, user profiles, and booking information efficiently. PHP facilitated
                        dynamic content generation, enabling functionalities such as user authentication, booking
                        processing, and data retrieval from the MySQL database. This project not only enhanced my
                        frontend development skills but also provided valuable experience in backend integration and
                        database management in a real-world web application context."</p>
